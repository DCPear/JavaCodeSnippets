The Sinhala and Tamil New Year (Aluth Avurudu in Sinhala) is a very important occasion for both Sinhala Buddhists and
the Tamil Hindus of Sri Lanka. The uniqueness of this occasion is the celebration of the beginning of the New Year as
well as the ending of the old year at the auspicious times stated by astrologers. There is also a time period in
between, which is called the Nonagathe (neutral period). During this time, people stop work and engage in religious
activities. In many village temples, the chiming of the temple bell is accompanied with the beating of drums to make
the people aware of the exact auspicious time to perform each ritual.
